Work Experience in Javascript.

# The Project with my experience in Javascript

This project was one of the first coding experiences with Add-ins using Visual Studio and the language of Javascript, HTML and CSS for making an Array of images and display images (JPG) using simple selection double click in the document Word.
Also, I use the CSS and the HTML for making the design of the Add-in the best way as possible, for the user to make the selection easier.

Every subject has an Array of images that will be displayed in a table for making the display I made a function for getting the call back function of the database of the images that are stored in the URL.
